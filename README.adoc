= El Cleanator

== About

El Cleanator's goal is to help you clean you local Maven repository 
or a remote repository such as Apache Archiva.

The chosen strategy is to be able to recognize grapes of Maven artifacts sharing a common parent pom
in order to get rid of all those artifacts at once.

In the future, it should be able to receive notifications of deleted branched from your SCM (such as Gitlab)
in order to automatically delete artifacts generated by the deleted branch.
